    <p>I am a full-stack developer with a current focus in JavaScript (React)
    and Java (Spring - Boot/Security/Data). I am experienced in setting up a
    new project from the ground up, and making sure components remain as modular
    and agnostic as possible. I believe in continuous delivery not only as a means
    of releasing software as quickly as possible, but also to ensure an active
    relationship with the customer in regards to their needs.
    </p>
    <p>
    It is important to me that my team enjoys working with one another, and
    cares about the products they create. I excel at helping others understand
    complex ideas/interactions without coming off as a condescending know-it-all.
    </p>
  </div>
