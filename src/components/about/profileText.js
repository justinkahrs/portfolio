    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a full-stack developer with a current focus in JavaScript (React) and Java (Spring). I especially enjoy using
      the latest tools that come along with modern JavaScript, including Webpack, Babel,and Jest.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love to learn new things, it's why I got into this business. I'm obsessed with reading up on the latest
      developer news and sharing all of my findings with my team. It's essential that we decide together what is right
      for the task at hand, and not simply give in to the latest trends (but it sure is fun to follow them!).
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important to me that my team enjoys working with one another, and cares about the products they create. I
      excel at helping others understand complex ideas/interactions without coming off as a know-it-all. Helping others
      is something that comes naturally to me and I enjoy every moment of it.
